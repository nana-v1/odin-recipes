## Recipe Project - HTML boilerplate

A basic recipe website project designated as an exercise to practice core HTML concepts. The primary objective is to properly structure content using semantic markupn before appying CSS styling in a later phase.

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Valid HTML5 structure
- ✅ Semantic HTML usage (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
- ✅ Recipe link navigation
- ✅ Secondary pages with basic content
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy ('h1 - h6')

## HTML Concepts Practiced
- Document boilerplate (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Text formatting (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, etc.)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Links (`<a>` with relative/absolute paths)
- Images (`<img>` with alt attributes)

## Next Steps (CSS Phase)
In a future iteration we'll enhance the project with:
- Responsive design
- Component styling
- Accessibility improvements
- Visual effects

## How to Contribute
This is a learning exercise project. If you'd like to suggest HTML structure improvements, please open an issue or submit a PR.
